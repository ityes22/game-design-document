# Competitive Analysis Template

Use this template for Section 16 (Competitive Analysis) of the GDD. A genuine competitive analysis does not cherry-pick convenient comparisons — it honestly assesses the landscape, identifies threats, and extracts specific lessons. Publishers use this section to evaluate market opportunity. A lazy competitive analysis (listing big titles without differentiation) damages credibility.

## Part 1: Competitor Identification

### Competitor Categories

| Category | Definition | Your Focus |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Direct | Same genre, same platform, same target audience | Highest threat; must differentiate explicitly |
| Indirect | Different genre but competes for the same player time/spend | Important for market sizing |
| Aspirational | What you want to be compared to (may be aspirational) | Reference for quality bar |

### Competitor Roster

List 5-8 titles. Include at least 3 direct competitors, 2 indirect competitors, and 1 aspirational comp.

| # | Title | Developer | Category | Release | Platforms | Revenue Signal |
|---|-------|-----------|----------|---------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | [Direct Comp 1] | [Dev] | Direct | [Year] | [Platforms] | [Sales data / player count / revenue estimate] |
| 2 | [Direct Comp 2] | [Dev] | Direct | [Year] | [Platforms] | [Data] |
| 3 | [Direct Comp 3] | [Dev] | Direct | [Year] | [Platforms] | [Data] |
| 4 | [Indirect Comp 1] | [Dev] | Indirect | [Year] | [Platforms] | [Data] |
| 5 | [Indirect Comp 2] | [Dev] | Indirect | [Year] | [Platforms] | [Data] |
| 6 | [Aspirational Comp] | [Dev] | Aspirational | [Year] | [Platforms] | [Data] |

## Part 3: Feature Comparison Matrix

The matrix should cover the features that matter most for your target audience's buying decision. Do not list every feature — list the differentiating features.

### Feature Matrix

## Part 4: Market Positioning Map

A positioning map plots the competitive landscape on two axes relevant to your game. The goal is to find white space — a position not currently occupied by a strong competitor.

### Positioning Map Description

**Axis 1:** [Relevant axis for your genre — e.g., "Casual ↔ Hardcore", "Story-Driven ↔ Gameplay-Driven", "Simple ↔ Complex systems"]

**Axis 2:** [Second relevant axis — e.g., "Short sessions ↔ Long sessions", "Solo ↔ Social", "Low price ↔ High price"]

```
HIGH [Axis 2]
     │
     │    [Comp A] ○         ○ [Comp B]
     │
     │              ★ [OUR GAME]
     │
     │    ○ [Comp C]
     │
     └────────────────────────────────
LOW [Axis 2]    CASUAL ──────── HARDCORE [Axis 1]
```

**Narrative:** "[Our Game] occupies [position description]. [Comp A] and [Comp B] are positioned [position description] — they share [description] but neither serves [our specific audience]. [Comp C] addresses a related need but [key difference]. Our white space is [description]: players who want [Axis 1 position description] with [Axis 2 position description], a segment currently underserved."

## Part 5: Market Gap Analysis

### The Unmet Need

State the specific player need that existing titles fail to satisfy, in the player's voice:

> **Player need statement:** "I want [experience description] but existing games either [problem with existing games] or [different problem]. I've been playing [Comp A] because it's the closest thing, but I always [specific frustration]. I would instantly switch to a game that [what they're looking for]."

**Evidence base:**
- [Steam review data: "X% of negative reviews on Comp A cite the frustration with Y"]
- [Reddit/Discord: "The most upvoted request in Comp B's subreddit is X, 18 months without a response from developers"]
- [Playtesting: "In our surveys, 73% of target audience players ranked [Feature] as their top missing feature in the genre"]

---

## Part 6: Competitive Differentiation Statement

The single-paragraph answer to "why should players choose this over existing alternatives?"

**Format:**
> "[Our Game] is the [specific adjective] [genre] game for [specific audience]. Unlike [Comp A], which [what Comp A does that's a limitation], we [what we do differently and why it's better for our audience]. Unlike [Comp B], which [limitation], we [our approach]. The single thing no competitor offers that we do: [your true differentiator — if you can't name one, go back to design]."

**Example:**
> "Void Cartographer is the only narrative roguelike deckbuilder with a living, persistent world shared by all players. Unlike Slay the Spire, which offers brilliant mechanics but zero narrative investment, we wrap every card play in layered story discovery. Unlike Hades, which offers great narrative but is single-player only, every deck-building choice in Void Cartographer visibly alters the world state for all 100,000+ concurrent players. The single differentiator: your solo runs have real, permanent consequences for a shared world — a design no direct competitor has attempted at commercial scale."

## Part 7: Lessons Learned from Competitors

Extract specific, actionable lessons from each competitor. Not "they have good monetization" — "their $9.99 battle pass captures 22% of active players because of the mid-season hero skin reveal moment."

| Title | Lesson | How We Apply It |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| [Comp 1] | [Specific lesson from their design, business model, or community] | [Concrete action in our design] |
| [Comp 2] | [Specific lesson] | [Our application] |
| [Comp 3] | [Specific lesson from their mistakes — be specific] | [How we avoid the same mistake] |
| [Comp 4] | [Specific lesson] | [Our application] |

---

## Part 8: Market Timing Assessment

| Factor | Assessment | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Market saturation | [Low/Medium/High] — [brief description of genre saturation] | [Sales data, release count per year] |
| Audience growth trend | [Growing/Stable/Declining] | [Source] |
| Competitive activity | [Quiet/Active/Very active] — [major releases in next 12 months] | [Known upcoming releases] |
| Platform opportunity | [Platform-specific trend] | [Platform data] |
| Why now? | [1-2 sentences: what makes this the right moment to launch this game] | [Evidence] |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Only listing huge AAA titles as comps | Makes you look unresearched (you're not competing with Elden Ring) | Include realistic direct comps at similar scope |
| No differentiation analysis | Why does this game need to exist? | Every comp needs explicit "what we do differently" |
| Strengths only, no weaknesses | Dishonest analysis damages publisher trust | Include genuine weaknesses — all games have them |
| "Our game is better at everything" | Unbelievable; raises skepticism | Honestly assess where comps have advantages |
| Outdated competitive data | Market moves fast; 2020 data is irrelevant for 2025 launch | Use data < 12 months old |
| Forgetting indirect competitors | Time spent on Candy Crush is time not spent on your game | Include 2 indirect comps minimum |
| Market gap without evidence | "No one does this" is easy to claim | Cite reviews, forums, sales data for gap evidence |
