# One-Page Pitch Template

A one-page pitch is a single-page document designed for cold outreach to publishers, sent ahead of a full GDD, or used as a quick-reference leave-behind after a pitch meeting. It must communicate the entire game concept in 60 seconds of reading. Every word earns its place.

## Section-by-Section Guide

### GAME TITLE + TAGLINE

**Title:** The game's working title. Can be changed later — but needs a name now.

**Tagline:** One sentence that communicates the core experience. Not a feature list. The best taglines sound like the player's experience, not the developer's description.

*Weak:* "A roguelike deckbuilding game with procedural dungeons"
*Strong:* "Build the perfect deck. Die with dignity. Start smarter."

*Weak:* "An open-world RPG with crafting"
*Strong:* "Civilization collapses. You have three tools, a lighter, and four hours to save it."

---

### HOOK (2 sentences)

**Sentence 1:** The experience. What does the player FEEL and DO? Not "players can explore a vast world" — that's nothing. "You are the last survivor of a deep-space colony ship with 72 hours of oxygen and 400 years of wrong turns to correct."

**Sentence 2:** The differentiation. Why does this game need to exist? What isn't currently doing what this does?

*Example:*
> "You build a civilization from a single campfire, making decisions that echo through 10,000 years of history you'll never see. Unlike Civilization's bird's-eye god-view, you experience every era from ground level — as a different citizen each playthrough."

---

### GENRE & PLATFORM + TARGET AUDIENCE

Keep both blocks to 3 lines maximum. For genre, use specific naming:
- NOT: "Action game"
- YES: "Roguelike deckbuilder with real-time combat"

For audience, be honest about who will actually buy this — not who you wish would:
- NOT: "Everyone who loves games"
- YES: "Ages 18–34, midcore PC gamers, 50+ hours in Slay the Spire"

---

### CORE GAMEPLAY LOOP (3 sentences)

Three sentences only. No bullet points here.

**Sentence 1:** The micro loop (2–5 minutes): what does the player do repeatedly?
**Sentence 2:** The macro loop (one session): how do micro loops build into a satisfying session?
**Sentence 3:** The return motivation: what brings the player back tomorrow?

*Example (roguelike deckbuilder):*
> "Each combat encounter, the player drafts 3 cards from a rotating hand, chains them into combos, and manages energy against escalating enemy patterns. After 5 encounters, they reach a rest point — spend earned runes on deck upgrades, healing, or unlocking permanent character abilities. Each run ends in either a boss kill (unlocking new card archetypes) or death (unlocking permanent meta-progression that makes the next run stronger)."

---

### KEY FEATURES (4 features, one sentence each)

The 4 things that will appear in every review, every trailer, every social post about this game. These are NOT generic features — every game has "compelling story" or "tight controls." These are the specific, named systems that define THIS game.

**Format:** `[Feature Name]: [What it does in one specific sentence]`

*Weak:* "Engaging combat system with many options"
*Strong:* "Momentum Combat: Every action — attack, dodge, parry — builds a Momentum meter that powers your most devastating skills. Let it drop and you're playing defense."

*Weak:* "Deep progression system"
*Strong:* "Permanent Echoes: Every run leaves a ghosted memory in the dungeon — enemies remember how you killed their predecessors and adapt their tactics permanently."

*Weak:* "Multiplayer features"
*Strong:* "Asynchronous Rivalry: Leave traps, messages, and modified boss encounters for specific friends to discover — receive in-game rewards when they trigger your traps."

---

### MONETIZATION (3 lines max)

State the revenue model clearly. If F2P, name the key monetization pillars. If premium, state the price point target. Do not be vague about money.

| Model | Format |
|-------|--------|
| Premium | "$19.99 premium. DLC expansions at $9.99. No subscriptions." |
| F2P | "F2P core. $9.99 Battle Pass (seasonal). Cosmetics IAP $0.99–$9.99. No gameplay P2W." |
| Subscription | "$4.99/month. All content included. No IAP." |
| Premium + F2P | "$29.99 base game. F2P multiplayer mode with cosmetics IAP." |

---

### COMPARABLE TITLES (3 comps max)

Naming comparable titles does three things: (1) tells the reader the market exists, (2) positions the game, (3) lets you show differentiation. Never name a comp without differentiation.

**Format:** `[Comp Title] × [Comp Title 2] — but [your differentiation]`

*Example:*
> "Slay the Spire × Hades — but with real-time combat and a persistent online world where player decisions shape the meta-game for all players."

**Rules for choosing comps:**
- At least one must have commercial data (was successful, establishes market size)
- At least one must be recent (within 3 years) to establish current market relevance
- Never comp a game bigger than you can plausibly be compared to (don't say "like Elden Ring" for your $200K indie)

---

### TEAM / STATUS (3-4 lines)

State facts, not aspirations. Publishers read 50 of these a week. Credibility signals matter:
- Team size
- Relevant shipped titles ("shipped [Game X] at [Studio Y], 500K units")
- Current dev status ("vertical slice complete," "prototype playable," "concept phase")
- [OPTIONAL] Funding status if it helps ("pre-seed funded," "self-funded through alpha")

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Bad Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|--------------|-----|
| "Revolutionary gameplay" | Every pitch says this. Means nothing | Describe the specific revolution |
| Comparable titles without differentiation | Makes you look the same, not different | Always add "but [your difference]" |
| Team section without shipped credits | Raises doubt about execution ability | Include any shipped title, any size |
| No status / dev stage | Publisher can't evaluate readiness | Always state current status |
| Vague monetization | Signals you haven't thought it through | State exact model and price points |
| More than 4 key features | Dilutes focus, suggests lack of design clarity | Pick the 4 best |
| Feature names without description | "Deep combat" means nothing | Name it + describe the actual system |
| Under-aged audience without safety plan | Publisher liability concern | Specify child safety measures |
